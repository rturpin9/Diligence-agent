# Corporate Governance - Due Diligence Analysis

## Executive Summary
Review of corporate documents reveals two critical issues: a deadlock provision in the Operating Agreement that could block transaction approval, and expired state registrations in 3 operating states.

## Critical Issues

### 1. Supermajority Deadlock Risk
- **Issue**: Operating Agreement Section 4.2 requires 75% member vote for any sale or merger
- **Source**: LLC Operating Agreement (operating_agreement.pdf, Section 4.2, p. 12)
- **Current State**: Two 40% members could block transaction (requires both to approve)
- **Implication**: Transaction may require renegotiation of governance terms or member buyout
- **Recommendation**: Obtain written consent from all members before proceeding

### 2. Expired State Registrations
- **Issue**: Foreign entity registrations expired in TX, FL, and NY
- **Source**: State Registration Certificates folder, cross-referenced with state database
- **Details**:
  - Texas: Expired 03/2024
  - Florida: Expired 01/2024
  - New York: Expired 06/2023
- **Implication**: Company may be operating illegally in these states; potential penalties and inability to enforce contracts
- **Recommendation**: Immediate reinstatement required; obtain penalty estimates

## Red Flags Summary
| Category | Issue | Severity | Source |
|----------|-------|----------|--------|
| Governance | Supermajority deadlock risk | Critical | operating_agreement.pdf |
| Compliance | Expired TX registration | Critical | state_registrations/ |
| Compliance | Expired FL registration | Critical | state_registrations/ |
| Compliance | Expired NY registration | Critical | state_registrations/ |
